# Eugene’s Film Eulogies

This is a Wordpress theme custom built for a local student film group specifically tailored for them to have multiple “types” of blogs (reviews).

# Motivation

I was hired to build a custom site by a film group at Missouri State University. Having never built a blog based site before, I did some research and came to the conclusion that building a highly customized Wordpress theme was the best course of action for this clubs needs. 

# Tech used

Built with: 
  - Wordpress (v7.2.2)
  - SCSS
  - PHP (v7.2)
  - jQuery (v3.3.1)
